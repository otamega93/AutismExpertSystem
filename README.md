# AutismExpertSystem
My final career project. The one who awarded me with an honorific mention.

This is a prototype of an expert system that diagnose autism in people between two and eighteen years old. 
It has its inference engine working like charm and handles data with a MySQL DB.

Since it escaped from the scope of the project when the presentation came, it doesn't render any report.

Since my mother language is spanish and I studied in a spanish speaking country, the program UI is completely in spanish. Even so, the code is all english.
